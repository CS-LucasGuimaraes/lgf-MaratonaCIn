## üí° Contest Reflection
I solved problems A, B, C, D and F very quickly. 

I just need to pay more attention when submitting code in python. I submitted Problem C in the wrong language, which generated a runtime error.

Problems E and F were not solved because I didn't know the content. It is interesting to revisit these Problems in the future.
This time, I didn't have any problems with timing purposes. I had almost an hour left when only Problems E and G were left.
