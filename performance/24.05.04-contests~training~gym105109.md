## üí° Contest Reflection
This was a group contest. Problems A and J were quick to read and solve.

After that, we wasted a lot of time on Problem E because we forgot to check the last iteration. This was a problem due to lack of attention that cannot happen in the future.

We got a TLE in Problem B, which is a misterious. No one knows why. We lost some time trying to find a solution to this either.

In Problem I, I tried to implement a modified Knapsack Algorithm, but, in order to accept more than one item, i used a greedy that was not correct. Although it didn't work, it was a nice try.

In problem F, I got nervous and made a lot of confusion with the index. I knew how to solve the problem. Things like this cannot happen.
