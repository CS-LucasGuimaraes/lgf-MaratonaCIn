## üí° Contest Reflection
In Problem A, I did not know how to evaluate an expression in a fast way. Learnt the function eval in python, that would solve this problem in just one line.
In Problem B, I missed some experience with strings. I need to work on that.
I solved fast the problem C, since the text is only distracting you. You can just solve it in the regular way and it will work properly.
In Problem D, I solved it in a very efficient way. Lost some time learning how to use upperbound and lowerbound. I need to train this two functions.
In Problem E, I've got a int overflow. Besided that, if i put long long, my solution takes a TLE. I learnt a way to do a "prefix" with the prime factors, need to test this. 
I did not understood Problem F propperly.
I did not had time to read Problem G and Problem H.
Problem I is a very simple one. Solved quickly.
In Problem J, I found the right solution on my notebook, but, when I was testing the sample cases, I made a mistake and found different values, which made me waste a lot of time and, later, give up on the question. (ATENTION PROBLEM).
In Problem K I did'nt figured out a way to test all the values in an efficient way. Probably, I did not think in the propper solution.
Problem L is a very cool problem. I could train my skills with masking and binary. Realy liked it during contest.
