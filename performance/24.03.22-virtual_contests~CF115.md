## 💡 Contest Reflection
I solved fast the problem A, since I had all the necessary parts included in my lib. No comments.

In problem B, I tried to solve with a greedy that did not work, getting a WA. Need to be more carefull when thinking in greedys. I decidided to change to another problem, because I did not saw a clear path to follow and I had no time to come back later. 

In problem C, I lost a lot of time (and got some WA) because of an int overflow. I didn't notice that, sometimes, the answer can overflow an normal int since it can go up to 2e5 * 2e5-1 > MAX_INT. Need to be more carefull with this.

I did not had time to think about the other problems to, finishing the virtual contest with only 2 ACs.
