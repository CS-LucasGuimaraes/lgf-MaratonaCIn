## üí° Contest Reflection
In Problem A, I spent some time trying to understand it correctly. I thought a little too much and tried to find a more complex solution than necessary. 

In Problem B, I spent a lot of time coding a maximum subarray algorithm (kadane) that should be in my library. Furthermore, it was difficult to work correctly with Modular Arithmetic, I had difficulties working with powers of two up to 2e5 mod 1e9+7. Need more practice on these types of MOD problems.

Because of these time problems, I didn't have time to work on the other problems. I could read them all. I had some ideas on how to solve Problem F, the others would need some more time to figure out how to solve them.
